# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
Overview

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from a bank, aiming to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the primary factors influencing customer churn. Additionally, a machine learning model is developed to accurately predict customer churn.
Dataset Details

The dataset includes diverse customer information such as credit scores, age, geographic location, gender, card type, tenure, account balance, and the number of products held by each customer.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, we explore the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. Various visualizations, charts, and statistical measures are employed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to customer churn.
Machine Learning Model Development

To address the predictive aspect, a machine learning model is constructed using a Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained and optimized to predict customer churn accurately.
Hyperparameter Tuning

The model's performance is further optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross Validation. This ensures the best possible configuration for predicting customer churn.
Model Evaluation

The final model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy and F1-score on a test set. This provides an indication of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
